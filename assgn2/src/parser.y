/* NOTE: mC has two kinds of scopes for variables : local and global. Variables declared outside any
function are considered globals, whereas variables (and parameters) declared inside a function foo are local to foo. You should update the scope variable whenever you are inside a production that matches function definition (funDecl production). The rationale is that you are entering that function, so all variables, arrays, and other functions should be within this scope. You should pass this variable whenever you are calling the ST_insert or ST_lookup functions. This variable should be updated to scope = "" to indicate global scope whenever funDecl finishes. Treat these hints as helpful directions only. You may implement all of the functions as you like and not adhere to my instructions. As long as the directory structure is correct and the file names are correct, we are okay with it. */

Hence, the circles you draw when drawing a parse tree, the following lines are telling yacc that these will eventually become circles in an AST. This is one of the connections between the AST you draw by hand and how yacc implements code to concretize that. We provide with two examples: program and declList from the grammar.
